# StockPulsePy Client - Project Proposal

## Project Overview

**Name of Project:**  
StockPulsePy Client

**Type of Project:**  
API Client (Option A)

**Project Purpose:**  
To create a user-friendly, efficient, and versatile Python interface for the StockPulse API(https://rapidapi.com/mbzkrm/api/stockpulse1). The project aims to facilitate access to stock market data and insights, serving the needs of financial analysts, data scientists, and hobbyist traders.What makes this project unique is that it focuses on analyzing the ESG performance of companies, which can help investors and stakeholders better understand the environmental and social risks faced by companies, as well as their ability to manage these risks. This helps assess potential financial risks and opportunities.

## Key Features

### Simplify API Access
- Develop an `ApiInitialize` class to streamline API key configuration and validation, making the API more accessible for developers.
- Implement the `validate_api` method to ensure the correctness and effectiveness of API keys, enhancing user confidence.

### Intuitive Stock Market Data Retrieval
- Utilize the `StockData` class to simplify the process of retrieving stock market data, supporting various modes like stock prices, ESG scores.
- Validate and handle query parameters effectively for alignment with user expectations and improved accuracy.

### Detailed Financial Information Retrieval
- Employ the `AnalyticsData` class for effortless retrieval of detailed financial information including analytics, news report, searching, earnings reports, and balance sheet data.
- Format returned data in Pandas DataFrame for ease of further processing and analysis.

### Visual Representation of Corporate ESG Performance Differences
- A line chart is used to show the difference in ESG performance of the three companies that users are most interested in.

### Data in Tabular Form
- Consistently return data in Pandas DataFrame format, allowing convenient manipulation and analysis.

### Flexible Optional Parameters
- Support multiple optional parameters for each functionality, enabling users to customize API calls based on their specific requirements.

## Technical Plan

### Function Development
- Develop functions within `ApiInitialize` for API key configuration and validation.
- Implement various data retrieval methods in `StockData` and `FinancialDetail` classes with robust error handling.

### Documentation and Presentation
- Write comprehensive docstrings for each function and class.
- Create a detailed README and Sphinx documentation for easy setup and usage.
- Prepare Jupyter Notebooks as practical examples to demonstrate capabilities.

### Testing and Validation
- Conduct thorough unit testing to ensure reliability and accuracy.
- Validate the package's functionality with real-world scenarios.

## Potential Hurdles
- Handling API rate limits and ensuring timely data retrieval in the volatile stock market.
- Maintaining the package in line with updates or changes in the StockPulse API.

## Final Remarks
The StockPulsePy Client aims to be a valuable tool in stock market analysis, offering a user-friendly interface and flexible data retrieval options, empowering users with powerful financial insights for their Python-based financial analysis toolkit.
